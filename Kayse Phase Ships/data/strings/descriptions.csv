kayse_wight,SHIP,"Modified from the Harbinger design, this phase ship trades its predecessor's firepower and armor for an enlarged an shielded cargo hold. The result is a fragile ship that can stealthily dart through gaps in a blockade with critical goods. 

""We'd been 'sieging that mining outpost for two cycles, yet when I connected to the stationmaster to discuss surrender terms, he was eating, I swear to Ludd, fresh fruit. We'd been eating nutrient paste and thrice recycled water and that 'roid with barely enough water to support thirty managed to keep five hundred souls alive and grow fruit? I don't believe it!"" 
- Memoirs of a Pirate Captain",,,
kayse_pyre,SHIP,"Redesigned from the Phaeton, this phase tanker will sustain a small phase taskforce's need for fuel. It also contains state-of-the-art landing guidance software that can accurately predict where the ship (or any jetsam) would ballistically land, accurate to within 300 meters in 95% tests. Allegedly, this would enable the Pyre to support raids with tactical bombing but Tri-Tachyon insists that system is merely a fail-safe for high-gravity worlds which might have unauthorized uses by unscrupulous pilots.

""First there was darkness. Then a glow appeared in the sky, streaming toward the base, followed seconds later by the crackle of antimatter containment rupturing. Crinkle, crackle, pop, hiss. Once the sounds stopped, we went over to assist in the rescue, thankful that our farms hadn't also been targeted.""

kayse_poltergeist,SHIP,"Designed around a miniaturized phase coil, this fighter can screen phase ships or attack weak targets with its burst PD Lasers. This fighter lacks the thick shielding that normally protects crew from the phase coil wash on larger ships. It is highly recommended that pilots undergo psychiatric reevaluation after each sortie.",,,
kayse_haunt,SHIP,"An adaptation of a Drover, this phase carrier can field a single wing of specially designed phase fighters, Poltergeists, which can synchronize their phase coils to the carrier's for the safety of all parties involved. The Haunt loses half of the Drover's hangar space and half of the missile hardpoints of its base hull in order to bring some screening to phase operations. Initial tests of attempting to launch non-phase fighters from a phase capable carrier resulted in mishap, after a mistimed phase resulted in [REDACTED].",,,
kayse_grim,SHIP,"Nearly everything that wasn't bolted down was stripped from a Wolf in order to make a quick phase ship for interdicting soft targets behind the enemy line. The Grim can also excel at interception and harassing roles, but cannot survive sustained warship attention. In order to save weight, the Wolf's front hardpoint has been replaced with an ion pulsor suitable to its designed role but strategically inflexible.

""The crews of Shades and Grims often form a unique rivalry. A popular game of Case the Cask often occurs where both ships' crews will attempt to steal the most expensive beverage from the other ship. Alternatively, if one ship can kill an enemy off of the tail off of the other, by tradition, the rescued captain will willingly give the other crew the expensive beverage.""
- PHASEOPS, The Invisible Navy",,,
kayse_ghoul,SHIP,"The result of captured or salvaged Gremlins upgraded with a Mark III Phase Cloak actuator and more modern modules, the Ghoul serves as an OPFOR phase ship in garrison exercises. While deployed, Ghouls provide supporting fire in combat, and are tasked with salvaging after combat, aided by a collapsible gantry crane filling some of the space that the Gremlin's larger phase cloak used to take up.",,,
kayse_dullahan,SHIP,"Modified from the Shrike design, this ship is designed as a flagship for PHASEOP flotillas of Destroyers and Frigates. It has the speed (and armament) of a frigate but the larger destroyer hull allows for powerful sensors and the processing power to effectively direct the flotilla on the battlefield.

In garrison, the Dullahan's computational power and extra space allows it to function as a phase-capable laboratory, testing how biological and material samples behave in p-space. Experiments now require approval of BOTH the ship captain and Science Director after past 'incidents'.

""It's not enough to be unseen and unexpected. Victory depends on also observing and expecting the enemy.""

nso_tombstone_description,CUSTOM,"During the AI Wars, this was better known at Brightstone, a garrison for PHASE capable warships and all of the bureaucracy required to keep a military base alive. While the raids and ships departing from this system were nearly invisible, the planet itself came under the crosshairs of the Hegemony and bombed the planet with nuclear and antimatter weapons. Tri-Tachyon investiment barely kept the planet alive as it regrew, but it still is a shadow of its former stature.",,"Other than some farms growing RAD resistant food staples, there is little to show that humans live on this planet. That is, until a shuttle flies out of a cunningly concealed hanger, hinting that this planet may conceal more.",
nso_crypt_description,CUSTOM,"During the AI Wars, this was better known at Citidel, a waystation for PHASE capable warships. Hegemony bombed the planet and it has been recovering since.",,"The snow and soot mix and fall in a grey dusting over the land, leaving streaks on any shuttlecraft flying through.",
no_such_org,FACTION,"This organization was originally the Tri-Tachyon PHASEOPS 3rd Task Force during the AI Wars. One of the final acts of the 2nd AI War was the Hegemony finding and bombing the PHASEOPS Task Force bases, with perhaps a bit more 'enthusiasm' than was strictly speaking required. When asked about the bombing for years afterwards, the offical Hegemony answer was that the planets nor organization did not exist, leading to the more modern name 'No Such Organization' from a repeated denial. The Tri-Tachyon Corporation helped partially rebuild the organization, then spun off the organization into an allied but deniable task force.

While Tri-Tachyon maintains the expertise on designing, researching and developing new phase designs, No Such Organization have taken the utilization of the Mark III Phase Cloaks actuator to the doctrinal extreme. If you can solve a problem by sticking Phase Coils on a ship, they will do so. If not, then they argue that you aren't using enough Phase Coils.",,,
